# RL_Based_MultiAgent_Trading_Systems
Multi-Agent Deep Q-Learning Based Trading System with Centralized Reward Optimization
 
ðŸ§© Project Overview:

This project aims to build a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) trading system where each agent is powered by a Deep Q-Network (DQN). Each agent learns to trade independently in a simulated market environment using candlestick chart data and technical indicators. The system applies a centralized reward mechanism to encourage cooperative strategies that collectively maximize portfolio profit. Agents are trained on historical market data and evaluated on back testing and live data streams.
